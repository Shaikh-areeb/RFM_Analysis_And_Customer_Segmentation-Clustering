# RFM Analysis and Customer Clustering Project

This project focuses on using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis and **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. 
The goal is to derive actionable insights for improving marketing strategies and enhancing customer retention.

---

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- Analyze key customer groups using **RFM Scores**.
- Use **K-Means Clustering** to identify customer clusters.
- Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns.

By analyzing RFM metrics, businesses can better understand their customer base and allocate resources effectively to improve customer retention and revenue.

## üåü Features
1. **RFM Score Calculation**:
   - Customers were scored on **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary Value**.
2. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segmented customers into distinct groups using **K-Means Clustering**.
3. **Cluster Insights**:
   - Analyzed characteristics of each cluster to derive business insights.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Provided actionable strategies tailored to each customer segment.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: [MySQL].
- **Calculated Columns**:
  
  - Recency (Days since last purchase)
  - Frequency (Number of purchases)
  - Monetary Value (Total spending)
  - RFM Customer Segments (Derived segments)

### RFM Customer Segments:
| RFM Segment            | Recency Score | Frequency Score | Monetary Score |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| At Risk Customers       | 2.34          | 1.01            | 1.64           |
| Can't Lose              | 1.54          | 1.00            | 1.46           |
| Champions               | 3.81          | 3.06            | 3.23           |
| Lost                    | 1.00          | 1.00            | 1.00           |
| Potential Loyalists     | 3.92          | 1.19            | 1.74           |

## üíª Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Extracted and cleaned data from a MySQL database.
- **Python**:
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and visualization.

---

## üîç Methodology
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Retrieved customer transaction data from MySQL.
2. **RFM Analysis**:
   - Calculated:
     - **Recency**: Days since the last purchase.
     - **Frequency**: Number of purchases.
     - **Monetary Value**: Total spending.
   - Scored customers on a scale to create RFM metrics.
3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Standardized RFM scores for clustering.
   - Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Segmented customers into 4 clusters.
4. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Plotted cluster distributions and analyzed group characteristics.
